## Auxiliary Logs Deployment
Everything you need to get started with Auxiliary logs in Sentinel

This template deploys almost everything you need to get started with Auxiliary logs in Sentinel using the AMA.  
- First, deploy the template.  
- Then associate the DCR and DCE with a log collector.  
- Now, as soon as you drop a log file that matches the pattern you specified, it lands in your new Aux table.
